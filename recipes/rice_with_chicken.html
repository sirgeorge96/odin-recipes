<h1>Rice with Chicken</h1>
<img src="../images/arroz-con-pollo-costa-rica.jpg">
<p>Ok so for you non-Spanish speakers out there arroz con pollo is Spanish for chicken with rice. 
    You might be picturing some white rice with chicken pieces next to it- and that is definitely not what chicken and rice is in Latin America.</p>

<p>Traditional Latin America arroz con pollo is a gorgeously colored dish that looks similar to Asian fried rice- except with chicken too!
     We color the rice with achiote and add cooked shredded chicken.</p>

     <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong>
        <li>Chicken breast, shredd</li>
        <li>Chicken broth</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Onion chopped</li>
        <li>Red pepper chopped</li>
        <li>Carrots chopper</li>
        <li>Celery chopped</li>
        <li>Garlic minced</li>
        <li>Cilantro (optional)</li>
        <li>Salsa Alfaro (English Sauce)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ol><strong>Steps</strong>
        <li>Get the skillet nice and hot on medium high heat and add about 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken on each side, seasoning well with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Only flip it once and make sure to wait until the chicken releases itself from the pan.</li> 
        <li>Once the outside starts to brown nicely, it should be fairly easy to flip. Don’t overcook it. Usually a few minutes on each side is all you need.</li>
        <li>After you’ve prepared the chicken, chop the onions, pepper, celery, carrots and mince the garlic.</li> 
        <li>The next step, sautéing, goes quickly so it’s nice to have everything ready in advance.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth to a medium saucepan with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil. Skip the salt if you’re using prepared broth that is already salty.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil on high heat, then add the rice and stir.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and cook uncovered (it should be at a low boil), stirring only every few minutes.</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, heat a medium skillet on medium high and add 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil. 
        <li>Add the onions, sauté for a couple of minutes, then add the pepper and celery. </li>            
        <li>After a couple of minutes more, add the carrots. Be sure to season everything with salt and pepper.</li> 
        <li>Once the carrots begin to soften, add the garlic and cook for a minute more.</li> 
        <li>When the veggies are al dente (cooked but still firm), add the achiote paste.</li>
        <li>When the veggies are al dente (cooked but still firm), add the achiote paste.</li>
        <li>Then add the shredded chicken and mix.</li>
        <li>Next, you’ll add the cooked rice, Salsa Alfaro, and fresh cilantro. </li>
        <li>Mix well until everything is coated in the achiote. Season with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
